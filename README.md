# QUIZHP
Quiz on Harry Potter This is my first project (Yay!). I had an idea of creating a short quiz with a very simple logic. I made it for my daughter who is a passionate Harry Potter fan. The quiz has just 3 questions.

Logic: By replying Yes, the user sees an alert message what indicates a corresponding character of Harry Potter saga. If the reply is No, then the previous question disappears and the new question appears.

Components: This project is written on html with css editing in "Harry Potter style" (background image is a flag of Gryffindor, colors of questions and div's background color are from Harry Potter's color palette). Script in JS is listening to DOMloading, is reacting to onclick events and returns alert messages.

Positive sides: the program is working exactly as I had it is my mind.

Improvement: Some functions are written in a repetitive manner and I guess it could be improved (maybe by adding if-else cycle). Also, I used raw JS for this task but I guess it could have been more efficient to use jQuery. And, what I really would like to edit is the style of the alert messages in order to make them more evident and maybe colorful.
